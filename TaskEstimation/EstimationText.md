# Task Estimation in Scrum

## Key Concepts:
**<u>Sprint Planning:</u>**

This is a crucial part in a scrum meeting as this is where the team collaborates and determines which tasks can be done in the current sprint.

 - Estimation based on available resources and time.

**<u>User Stories:</u>**

User Stories provides an informal, natural language description of a feature of the software or product from the end-user perspective.

- Informal, natural language descriptions of software features from the end-user perspective.
- Improves transparency and ensures delivery of highest value.
- Prevents confusion by providing clear task descriptions.

According to numerous articles that I have read sprint planning sets clear defined goals, fosters communication, and promotes collaboration, while user stories are crucial for transparency and delivering the highest value, as they provide clear and concise task descriptions, preventing confusion within the team.

### Challenges and Skills:

**<u>Effort of Peers</u>**

If certain members within the team are not "pulling their weight" it could affect the group as a whole and can lead to several disagreements and could affect the team as a whole.

- Lack of contribution affects team dynamics, leading to disagreements and decreased morale.
- Consequences: Decreased morale, increased workload, and failure to meet targets.

In this article it briefly describes a scenario but the key thing is from here that the slack of one person was creating frustration "Frustrated, he looked to Ann's desk and she was not there again". Not putting in effort can bring down the team's morale, increase workload and prevent the team from hitting their target.

**<u>Skill Difference:</u>**

Team members have different skills and experience in a group. This can lead to expectations being set and not being met.

- Varied skills and experience levels among team members lead to differing expectations and outputs.


### Personal experiences on Task estimation in Scrum

After delving into multiple articles on task estimation, a compelling pattern emerges, indicating shared struggles among different teams. A significant challenge revolves around the clarity of assigned tasks, often leading to complications in subsequent Scrum meetings. To address this issue effectively, a practical approach involves documenting task requirements and systematically checking them off during the progress, providing teams with a clear roadmap.

Task duration estimation poses another common challenge, with various methods available based on the nature and scope of each activity. A recommended strategy involves breaking down tasks into smaller activities, facilitating a more accurate assessment of time requirements for each component.

Different opinions naturally arise during task estimation, particularly regarding resource allocation and task duration. An intriguing solution found in one article involves a methodical weighing of the pros and cons of each opinion, leading to a consensus even in the face of disagreement. This approach highlights the importance of open communication and collaborative decision-making in refining the task estimation process.
