# Effective Sprint Planning

## What is Sprint Planning?
Sprint Planning is a crucial event in Scrum that kicks off the sprint. Its main objectives are to define what the sprint will deliver and outline how the team will achieve these deliverables. This event hinges on three essential components: setting a sprint goal, understanding the teamâ€™s capacity, and prioritizing backlog items. Effective sprint planning aligns the team's efforts, sets clear expectations, and lays the foundations for a successful sprint by focusing on what's most important and achievable.
