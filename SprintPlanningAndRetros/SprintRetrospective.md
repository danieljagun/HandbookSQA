# What is a Sprint Retrospective?
The Sprint Retrospective concludes each sprint, offering the team an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has just ended. The aim of the retrospective is to highlight what worked well and identify challenges faced, encouraging a culture of continuous improvement. By discussing these aspects, the team pinpoints areas for improvement and agrees on actionable steps to enhance future sprints.
